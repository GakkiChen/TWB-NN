# Trimmable Wide Binary Neural Network

## Abstract
Automated the design of accurate, fast, and memory-efficient binary networks, via coarse-grained structure expansion and
pruning in an end-to-end manner through the use of a differentiable soft-gate function. 

In collaboration with Dr. Lin Jie and Dr. Geng Xue from ASTAR.
